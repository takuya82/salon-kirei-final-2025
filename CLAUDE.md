# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a fresh, empty project directory. No codebase currently exists to analyze.

## Getting Started

This directory is ready for new project initialization. The specific technology stack, build tools, and architecture will be determined based on the project requirements.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance for development work. Please follow the guidelines and requirements below when proceeding with development.

## AI Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Principles

#### 1. Environment Variables and Secret Management
- **Absolutely Prohibited**: Hardcoding API keys, DB connections, or secrets
- **Client-side Exposure**: Handle sensitive information and personal data only on the server side
- **Service Role Keys, Secret Keys, Admin Keys** must be used only on the server side
- **Production Environment Credentials** must never be written directly in code

#### 2. Database Security
- Always enable Row Level Security
- Implement least privilege policies
- Use server-side validation for all database operations
- **Never perform SQL operations from frontend**, implement safe DB operations in backend
- Avoid direct SQL query concatenation, thoroughly implement SQL injection countermeasures

#### 3. API Implementation Security
- Mandatory input validation using schema validation
- Implement rate limiting
  - Per user: 100 requests/minute
  - Per IP: 1000 requests/hour
- Safe error handling that doesn't expose internal details
- Protection from user enumeration attacks
- Implement authentication for all API endpoints
- Filter unnecessary data with output filtering

#### 4. Authentication and Account Security
- Client secrets must be used only on the server side
- Implement CSRF protection
- Use cryptographically secure token generation
- Prohibit storing unencrypted passwords

#### 5. Authorization Management
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Protect admin actions
- Prevent privilege escalation
- Apply need-to-know principle

#### 6. Security Headers
- Implement strict security headers
- Implement CSP headers (must add if not implemented)
- Prevent clickjacking
- Control content type options
- Set referrer policy
- Restrict permissions policy

#### 7. XSS Prevention
- Always sanitize user-generated content
- Use libraries like DOMPurify
- Never insert HTML directly without sanitization
- Thoroughly apply SafeText component

#### 8. Log Management
- **Production Environment**: Remove console.log containing personal or sensitive information
- **Development Environment**: Display only necessary logs
- Never output API keys or passwords to logs
- Prohibit displaying debug information containing user personal data

#### 9. Data Protection and Privacy
- **Minimize Collection**: Collect only necessary minimum data
- **Encryption**: Encrypt at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Apply need-to-know principle
- **Retention Period**: Securely delete data when no longer needed

### Development Build Workflow

When implementing features or making major adjustments, always execute the following steps:

1. **After Code Changes**
   - Run `npm run build` to check for build errors

2. **If Errors Occur**
   - Report error details
   - Implement fixes
   - Check build again

3. **After Confirming Build Success**
   - Report "Build succeeded. Ready for deployment"

**Required Checks for**:
- After new feature implementation
- After multiple file changes
- After type definition changes
- After import/export changes
- After removing unnecessary code

### Secure Development Practices

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Confirm input validation implementation
- [ ] Proper authentication and authorization implementation
- [ ] No sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] No personal information output to logs
- [ ] SQL injection countermeasures
- [ ] XSS countermeasures implemented
- [ ] CSRF countermeasures implemented
- [ ] Admin privilege takeover countermeasures
- [ ] Prevention of important information leaks from server

#### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Use environment variables
- [ ] Enable RLS and set policies
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Secure error messages
- [ ] Protect sensitive user data
- [ ] Server-side permission checks

### Prohibited Actions

#### Security - Things You Must Never Do
- ❌ Write production environment credentials directly in code
- ❌ Output API keys or passwords to logs
- ❌ Display debug information containing user personal data
- ❌ Direct SQL query concatenation (causes SQL injection)
- ❌ Store unencrypted passwords
- ❌ Ignore or work around security warnings
- ❌ Copy production data to development environment

#### Denied Command Permissions
- Strict security measures to prevent destructive bash commands
- Denied Commands:
  - `Bash(rm -rf /)`
  - `Bash(rm -rf ~)`
  - `Bash(rm -rf ~/*)`
  - `Bash(rm -rf /*)`

#### Code Quality - Things Not to Do
- ❌ Swallow errors (catch and do nothing)
- ❌ Meaningless try-catch abuse
- ❌ Easy use of 'any' in TypeScript
- ❌ Abuse of eslint-disable
- ❌ Implementation ignoring existing design patterns

#### Destructive Operations - Things Not to Execute Without Confirmation
- ❌ Database deletion or reset
- ❌ Direct deployment to production
- ❌ Bulk update/deletion of large amounts of data
- ❌ Migration without backup
- ❌ Major dependency changes (major version upgrades, etc.)

#### Performance - Implementations to Avoid
- ❌ Code with possibility of infinite loops
- ❌ Leaving N+1 query problems
- ❌ Loading huge data into memory at once
- ❌ Executing synchronous heavy processing on UI thread
- ❌ React implementations causing unnecessary re-renders

#### UX - Things Not to Do
- ❌ Delete data without user consent
- ❌ Discard unsaved changes
- ❌ Display nothing on error
- ❌ No progress display for long processes
- ❌ Implementation ignoring mobile compatibility
- ❌ Implementation not considering accessibility

#### Automation - Things Requiring Human Judgment
- ❌ Fully automated production deployment (approval process required)
- ❌ Automatic deletion of user data
- ❌ Automatic execution of billing or payments
- ❌ Automatic delivery of important notifications (content verification required)
- ❌ Automation of processes with legal implications

#### AI Behavior
- ❌ State uncertain things definitively
- ❌ Statements that downplay security risks
- ❌ Vague assurances like "probably okay"
- ❌ Hide errors or bugs
- ❌ Ignore user concerns

### Recommended Responses

#### Security Focus
- ✅ Always use environment variables
- ✅ Always validate input values
- ✅ Handle errors appropriately

#### Confirmation and Communication
- ✅ Always confirm destructive operations
- ✅ Ask questions when uncertain
- ✅ Explain risks in advance

#### Things to Always Confirm
- "Delete production database?"
- "This operation cannot be undone. Continue?"
- "X records will be affected. Execute?"

### Examples of Absolutely Bad Code

```javascript
// ❌ Absolutely Bad - Hardcoding
const apiKey = "sk-123example90abcdef";

// ❌ Absolutely Bad - Password logging
console.log(`Password: ${user.password}`);

// ❌ Absolutely Bad - SQL Injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ❌ Swallowing errors
try {
  await someFunction();
} catch (error) {
  // Do nothing - Absolutely bad
}

// ❌ Abuse of any
const data: any = await fetchData(); // Should be typed

// ❌ N+1 Problem
users.forEach(async (user) => {
  const posts = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ${user.id}`);
});

// ❌ Bulk processing of huge arrays
const hugeArray = await fetchAllRecords(); // 1 million records
const processed = hugeArray.map(item => complexProcess(item));
```

**Security is not an afterthought but a core design principle integrated from the beginning.**
